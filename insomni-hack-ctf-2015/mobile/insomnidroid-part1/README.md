# Insomni'hack CTF 2015: InsomniDroid Level 1

**Category:** Mobile
**Solves:** 0
**Description:** 

> Hi Girlz,
> 
> I was yesterday night with D.J. Paris and this other girl. You know, this girl with blond hair. I found a Samsung phone on the floor (or maybe it was in her pocket) and I am sure there are interesting things inside it. Unfortunately, the device is encrypted. I know you are the best hackers in the universe, so please, please, please have a look.
> 
> I have made a bit-by-bit copy of the storage.
> 
> The device is a Samsung W (GT-I8150) and apparently it runs the Cyanogen flavour of Android KitKat.
> 
> IMPORTANT: You can solve this challenge with an Android device or emulator but also WITHOUT.
> Author : Britney - Difficulty : medium
